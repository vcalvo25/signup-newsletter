What I learned
I learned how to make sites more interactive through the use of JavaScript to add a popup element to display a success message. Additionally, I further honed my skills on making elements more responsive using media queries.

Useful resources
Scrimba's JavaScript course - https://scrimba.com/learn-javascript-c0v - This free course helped me to understand the basics of JavaScript, allowing me to create the popup element for this challenge with ease.
